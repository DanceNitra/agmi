# Scorecard

Generated from the results file by `agmi.render`; do not edit by hand. Run of 2026-10-02 on Darwin arm64, Python 3.12. Attack versions: tamper@v1, truncate@v1, delete_middle@v1, reorder@v1, forge@v1, cross_replay@v1, rollback_replay@v1, metadata_tamper@v1, memory_injection@v3, cross_session_bleed@v2, retrieval_hijack@v4, indirect_prompt_injection@v3, update_poisoning@v1, metadata_poisoning@v1. Attacker levels: at-rest attacks assume store access (level 3); front-door attacks assume write access to the memory API (level 2); content-only attacks (level 1) are not in this table.
